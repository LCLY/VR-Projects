REQUIREMENTS: Maya 2015 SP6, mental ray for Maya, software to unzip files.

HOW TO: The zip file should have a project folder. Please set the project to the project folder or the images to connect automatically. The model is linked to normal maps, so you will need mental ray to render it correctly. Direct questions, suggestions and requests to ashwin.inamdar@gmail.com.
